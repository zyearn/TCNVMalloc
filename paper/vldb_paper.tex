\section{Introduction}

Dynamic random-access memory(DRAM) has been used as the main memory of computer system for a long time, which is a type of random-access memory that stores each bit of data in a separate capacitor within an integrated circuit. 
However, with the great demand of performance and enerygy-constrain application, the defects of DRAM has become a main concern, for example, the limited density and its high energy consumption. 
In order to address these problems, an emerging new technology named non-volatile memory(NVM) has been proposed, such as Phase-change memory(PCM), spin torque, and memristor. 
NVM has the advantages of low latency, low power consumption and byte-addressable, which makes it a better alternative when compared  to DRAM.

However, some non-volatile memories suffers from limited write endurance. 
Let we take PCM as example. A typical PCM cell permanently fails after nearly $10^7$ to $10^9$ writes. 
In such circumstance, some write-intensive applications will break the PCM in a short time. 
Moreover, many hardware-level wear-awareness policies have been proposed. 
But the popularization of these specified hardware is much slower than the popularization of NVM in the near future. 
What’s more worse, the legacy hardware system then can not use NVM. 
In order to tackle ``write-too-intensive'' problem and support a software-level wear-aware memory allocator, a new memory allocator targeted for NVM platform must be designed and used in nowadays’ applications running on NVM.

Moreover, present wear-aware allocators without hardware-level wear-leveling also don’t support global wear-leveling. 
For example, if an application calls malloc-like interface to get a writeable PCM address, excessive writes to this PCM cell can rapidly destroy it. 
This is not the thing that a memory allocator can control without explicit hardware modifications. It remains a problem we must solve otherwise PCM will be damaged much earlier than we expect.

In this paper, we propose a wear-aware allocator that provide wear-awareness without degrading the performance of allocator compared with state-of-the art allocator. 
Specifically, tcwamalloc concerns three main folds of metadata memory write-reduction, thread arenas with a dedicated wear-aware allocation policy and APIs to support global. 
First, it decouples metadata and data management. Generally speaking, putting metadata into DRAM will decrease plenty of writes to NVM. 
Besides, we provide a wear-aware memory allocation policy without degrading the performance when compared to other NVM and DRAM allocators. 
At last, tcwamalloc implement a mechanisms that allow users do the global wear-leveling without the help of modifications in hardware.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item xxxx
    \item xxxx
    \item xxxx
    \item experiment...
\end{enumerate}

We have implemented a prototype version of tcwamalloc and evaluated its performance and some critical aspects against state-of-the-art memory allocators. 
Experiment shows that for most cases tcwamalloc outperforms prior system in average block allocation times and allocation latency.

\section{Design of tcwamalloc}

In this section, we propose tcwamalloc, an memory allocator for non-volatile memory with the dedicated design for wear-aware purpose without the descend of allocation performace.

\subsection{Design Principles}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The most important design goal of tcnvmalloc is wear-levelling. Hence, every time we call tcwamalloc’s API to gain a writeable address, a memory block with least allocation times is expected to return to us. However, a strict policy which return the exact block with least allocation times may take plenty of latencies. ln the later section will see a great tradeoff to tackle this problem.
    \item Another requirement is low latency, otherwise the memory would probably become the bottleneck of the entire program, which results in the allocator to be useless. To reduce the allocation latency, a local heap should be used by every thread to reduce the possible lock contention, and all memory managed by thread local heap should be allocated from a global heap. however, using lock when request/free memory from global heap is inevitable, as we will see, this is the only lock we use in the whole allocator.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Overview Stucture}

In this subsection, we will dig more deeper into the design architecture of tcwamalloc. The stucture of tcwamalloc is showed in Figure xx. tcwamalloc maintains a local heap for each thread, and a global heap for all threads. The reason why we use such a design is from the obvious observation that if a request from a thread can be satisfied by its local heap, the allocation latency will be very low since there is no lock contention which may degrade the performance. However, there must be a global heap that manage all the memory that maintained by each thread, therefore a lock must be involved. One of our implementation focus is emphasized on how to reduce the use of lock to the best of our ability.

[img]overall architecture

Each local heap contains several fix-sized memory chunk. Each memory chunk is further divided into several memory block according to the size class. Each thread maintains an array of in-use memory chunk, an array of list that contains a list of waiting chunk and a free list to hold empty chunk. When a thread makes a memory request of some certain memory class and there is no corresponding in-use chunk to answer that request, the corresponding chunk in waiting list is examined to become a in-use chunk. If still no usable memory chunks can be found, the free list in the local heap or global heap will be visited based on our wear-aware policy, which will be discussed in the further subsection.

\subsection{Memory Chunk}

Memory chunk is the basic building block that would be transferred between global heap and local heap. A memory chunk consists of two parts: a small chunk header and a 64KB chunk body. Chunk body is divided into several memory block based on the size class, obviously, with smaller size class comes more memory blocks. Chunk header stores some metadata such as remaining free blocks number, size class, chunk owner and so on.

Since a memory chunk body only contains 64KB memory, all the memory request smaller than 64KB is regarded as small request,
which is directly handled by local heap without additional locking in the global heap and 
The usable memory block in a memory chunk can be classified into two categories: first-allocated objects and reusable objects,
shown in the figure xx. 
All the blocks starting from the free pointer or at the free list is ready to be allocated to users.
How to allocate these free blocks is the key to our wear-aware strategy, which will be discussed in following subsections.

[img] chunk header指向chunk内存块的关系

The memory chunk size is very critical to the performance of wamalloc. 
If the chunk size is too small, the memory block will be used up very soon and frequently communicating with the global heap will greatly decrease the performance.
If the chunk size is too large, lots of memory blocks may remain clean or unused, which leads to a huge memory waste. 
A working method used by many other allocator is to choose chunks of small size to serve small blocks, and chunks of large size to serve large blocks.
The reason why they adopt this method is that there will always be avaliable usable memory blocks no matter what size class it belongs to.
The drawbacks are also obvious.
Since the memory chunk size is different, it increases the complexity of global heap to manage these chunks.
Consequently this will cause the extra time plenalty and the possible memory fragment, which may lead to more physical memory than an application realy needs.

Take the above discussions into consideration, we use an uniform memory chunk size for all size class. 
In most cases, memory requests are small allocations, which are naturly guaranteed that there are several usable memory blocks. 
For a special case, if a memory request is 64KB, there is only one block in the entire chunk body, so the allocation policy just view this block as the last remaining block and return it to the application. After that if the application needs a new 64KB memory, a new chunk is allocated to serve this request.
Further, This design gives us several other benifits: 
1) Since all memory chunks are of the same size, then an empty chunk can easily be transferred from one size class to another without any particular actions.
The only overhead is to modify the metadata of the chunk, which can be negligible when compared to the non-uniform chunk size schema. 
2) The uniform memory chunk simplified the design of global heap, which results in a lower time latency when communicating with global heap.

\section{Final Thoughts on Good Layout}
Please use readable font sizes in the figures and graphs. Avoid tempering with the correct border values, and the spacing (and format) of both text and captions of the PVLDB format (e.g. captions are bold).

At the end, please check for an overall pleasant layout, e.g. by ensuring a readable and logical positioning of any floating figures and tables. Please also check for any line overflows, which are only allowed in extraordinary circumstances (such as wide formulas or URLs where a line wrap would be counterintuitive).

Use the \texttt{balance} package together with a \texttt{\char'134 balance} command at the end of your document to ensure that the last page has balanced (i.e. same length) columns.
